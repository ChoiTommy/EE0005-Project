# EE0005 Machine Learning Project

## Dataset

Fake Job Posting Prediction from
https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction

## Objective
To train a classification machine learning that can distinguish whether a job posting is fraudulent.

## Procedure
1. [Exploratory analysis](https://github.com/ChoiTommy/EE0005-Project/blob/main/1.%20Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb)
2. [Dataset cleaning](https://github.com/ChoiTommy/EE0005-Project/blob/main/2.%20Dataset%20Cleaning.ipynb)
3. [Machine Learning](https://github.com/ChoiTommy/EE0005-Project/blob/main/3.%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb)

## Result
Random forest model gives the best result in terms of accuracy and F1-score.

>Accuracy on test set: ~ 0.98

>F1-score on test set: ~ 0.85

## Usage
It can be deployed on job searching platforms to tag and filter out fake job postings.
